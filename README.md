## Design
    
* Colour scheme
    * The colour scheme is simple yet easy on the eyes, Black, Grey and white.
* Typography 
    * The Texturina font was used for the headings, while the Playfair Display font was used for the text.
        The Texturina font is bold with smooth edegs, and Playfair is a fine yet professional text.
* Imagery 
    * The imagery was a big part of this site, as people would want to see what the places they was reading about looked like.
